This file is to offer a rough list of differences between SpiderV8 and stock V8.

SpiderV8 is a fork of V8 for SpiderOS (https://github.com/danopia/spideros),
an attempt to embed V8 in a kernel.

I (@duckinator) hope to make the majority of these changes be handled by a patch
that adds a handful of  #ifdef/#ifndef instances.

You can find more information about specific changes at https://github.com/danopia/spiderv8/commits/master

General changes:
* Removed d8 and mksnapshot.
* Logging uses klog() instead of logging to disk.
* All fopen/fwrite/fclose/etc references removed.
* LiveObjectList removed.
* Possibly removed sockets. Only needed used to support debugging.
* New build system (will eventually be modified to be compatible with the old one).
* Removed function for opening temporary files.
* Removed functions for determining PID. (Better approach: dummy getpid/GetCurrentProcessID?)
* Removed hton and ntoh.
* Removed "accessory binaries" (What the heck are those? http://git.io/pQhP8A)
